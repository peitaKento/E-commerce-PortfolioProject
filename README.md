### <ins>Process Phase</ins>
* Remove the specific time for the “Purchase Date”, “Payment Method”, “Customer Name” and “Churn” columns. 
* Change the format of the date (DD-MM-YYYY)
* The initial dataset has price, quantity, and the total purchase amount. The total purchase amount would be calculated by price*quantity, but the number in the initial data is different. I’m going to remove the total purchase amount data for more consistency.
